## How to Use

Click on a button of the cartoon character that you would like to see.

Many gifs style photos will populate the screen. When you click one of those gifs, they will play the animation. When you click again, the animation will stop.

You can add more cartoon characters to the buttons by inputing their name to the input box.

You may have to "allow pop-up" depending on what browser you are using.
